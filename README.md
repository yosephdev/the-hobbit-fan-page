# Building The Hobbit Fan Page: Thorin and Company

This document outlines the steps to build a Flask web application from scratch. The application will serve as a fan page for Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves from J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel, *The Hobbit*. The app will provide information about the characters, their quest, and allow fans to share their thoughts and appreciation.

## Planned Features
- **Character Profiles:** Detailed profiles of Thorin and each member of his company, including their backgrounds, personalities, and roles in the quest.
- **Quest Overview:** A comprehensive overview of the dwarves' quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
- **Fan Forum:** A dedicated forum where fans can discuss their favorite characters, share fan art, theories, and engage with fellow enthusiasts.
- **Merchandise:** A section showcasing official and fan-made merchandise related to *The Hobbit* and the dwarves' company.

## Technologies to be Used
- **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework that I will use for building the application.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup and styling languages for creating the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based database management system that I will use for storing user data and forum posts.

## Steps to Build the Application
To build the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-hobbit-fan-page.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd the-hobbit-fan-page
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  

   On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   flask run

7. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the fan page.

I will update this README.md file as I progress through building the Flask app, adding more details and instructions as needed.
